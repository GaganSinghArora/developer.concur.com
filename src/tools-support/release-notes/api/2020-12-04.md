## <a name="ongoing-request-retirement"></a>Ongoing: Retirement and Decommission of Existing Concur Request APIs (v1.0, v3.0, v3.1)

Effective July 1, 2020, SAP Concur has retired the Concur Request APIs (v1.0, v3.0, and v3.1). These APIs are replaced by the Concur Request v4 API.

### Business Purpose / Client Benefit

The Concur Request APIs v1.0, v3.0, and v3.1 only support the previous authentication method, which is not best security practice and does not meet the Oauth2 standards. In addition, the previous versions of the Concur Request APIs provided limited possibilities for moving a Request through the approval workflow, as well as managing custom simple & connected list fields. These issues are resolved with the new Concur Request v4 API.

In addition, SAP Concur has run a backward compatibility project between the current Concur Request APIs and the new Concur Request v4 API (not iso-compatibility) in order to have the vast majority of use cases managed in the previous versions also be managed in the Concur Request v4 API.

## <a name="travel-profile-deprecation"></a>Planned Changes: Travel Profile Notification v1 API Deprecation

SAP Concur is deprecating the Travel Profile Notification v1 APIs due to low usage.

### Business Purpose / Client Benefit

The Travel Profile Notification v1 APIs support older, less secure authentication methods.

### Configuration / Feature Activation

The Travel Profile v1 APIs are being deprecated in accordance with the [SAP Concur API Lifecycle & Deprecation Policy](https://developer.concur.com/tools-support/deprecation-policy.html).

## <a name="planned-leu-v4"></a>Planned Changes: Launch External URL v4 Callout

The Launch External URL v4 callout enables Concur Expense to display a field with a button that launches a separate browser window when clicked. The window is controlled by an application connector, created by a third-party developer or the client. The application connector is a web server that presents information in the window.

**NOTE:**	The Launch External URL v4 will be replacing the current Launch External URL v1 callout in a future release.

### Business Purpose / Client Benefit

The Launch External URL v4 callout gives clients and third-party developers the ability to extend the functionality of the SAP Concur platform, providing a means to deliver custom user interactions, or access functionality found in an external system.

The Launch External URL v4 callout will be available for Concur Expense within SAP Concur’s mobile app and NextGen UI at the Report Header, Expense Entry, or Allocation levels, which expands the locations of the feature as compared to the previous version. The Launch External URL v4 callout will provide enhanced security benefits, such as leveraging the latest SAP Concur API authentication methods. The Launch External URL v4 will also offer additional parameters and will work in conjunction with SAP Concur’s more advanced v4 APIs.

### Configuration / Feature Activation

The Launch External URL callout is activated through the Application Connector Registration process through Web Services.

## <a name="planned-company-token"></a>Planned Changes: Company Request Token Self-Service Tool

SAP is releasing a new Company Request Token self-service tool within the Concur Travel and Concur Expense products. This tool allows client administrators to generate Company Request Tokens, which are necessary to generate Company JWTs, to connect to APIs in the SAP Concur platform. The Company Request Token page will be accessible to users within the Authentication Admin tool.

The user inputs their Client ID in the App ID field and clicks Submit. The generated Company Request Token has a token lifetime of 24 hours. The token should be exchanged for the Refresh Token and Access Token using the Password Grant process. The Password Grant steps are outlined on the Company Request Token page and the SAP Concur Developer Portal for the user’s reference.

This feature is available to all users with the required permissions:

  1. **Company Administration:** This permission is needed to view the **Company Request Token** page in **Administration > Company > Authentication Admin**
  2. **Web Services Administrator:** This permission is needed to create the Company Request Token

### Business Purpose / Client Benefit

This feature allows Company Admins to generate Company Request Tokens that are needed to request a Company JWT for accessing SAP Concur APIs. This feature allows users to generate Company Request Tokens as a self-service without relying on SAP Concur internal staff. This self-service process reduces the turnaround time needed to request the Company JWT significantly and allows the user to manage their own token credentials in a safe and secure manner. If the Company Request Token is misplaced or expired, the user can access this tool to generate a new Company Request Token without assistance from SAP Concur Support.

### Configuration / Feature Activation

Once released, it will be available to all clients with Concur Expense or Concur Travel, and the required user roles.

## <a name="list-v4"></a>List v4 API Available

A new version of the List API is available. The List v4 API allows you to view your configured lists and create new lists within SAP Concur products.

### Business Purpose / Client Benefit

The List v4 API uses more secure and modern, fine-grained methods. This API uses Universal Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) and uses JSON instead of XML. Also, authentication to the List v4 API may be performed with a User or Company access token, providing the opportunity to apply the principle of least privilege.

### Configuration / Feature Activation

Users must be an Expense, Invoice, Shared, or Request Configuration Administrator to configure this API.

## <a name="list-item-v4"></a>List Item v4 API Available

A new version of the List Item API is available. The List Item v4 API provides solutions to retrieve and manage list items.

### Business Purpose / Client Benefit

The List Item v4 API uses more secure and modern, fine-grained methods. This API uses Universal Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) and uses JSON instead of XML. Also, authentication to the List Item v4 API may be performed with a User or Company access token, providing the opportunity to apply the principle of least privilege.

### Configuration / Feature Activation

Users must be an Expense, Invoice, Shared, or Request Configuration Administrator to configure this API.
