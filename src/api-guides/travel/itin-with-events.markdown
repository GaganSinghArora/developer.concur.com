## <a name="introduction"></a>Introduction

The event driven GET Itinerary V4 API will provide a scalable solution by allowing partners to get near real time updates for trips being created, updated, cancelled, deleted, and anonymized.

## <a name="data-scope"></a>Data Scope

Events will be raised for all trips saved to the itinerary data store. This includes trips booked in Concur Travel, offline with a TMC, or directly with a TripLink supplier. It also includes plans sent by users to TripIt travel segments added to Concur Request. Data sources can be differentiated by source, documented in the [References for Enumeration Types](#references) section.

Because some sources of travel data are indirect (through email parsing, for example) or only signal traveler intent, it is not uncommon for records to be incomplete or populated with suspicious data. Data customers must develop a strategy for incomplete records, as appropriate for their use cases. For example, in duty of care services, a flight from JFK to LHR without a flight number (or a fake flight number), should be interpreted as traveler intent to be in London on that date.

## <a name="event-details"></a>Event Details

The Event Subscription Service (ESS) enables the set up/creation of a subscription using partnerâ€™s App & a webhook. Using the following resources, the end point can be set up and a subscription to the Travel Itinerary Event can be created.

## <a name="itinerary"></a>Itinerary V4 API

Using a Company Level Token and the href from the Events payload, partners use the Itinerary V4 API endpoint to obtain trip details.

#### Itin Source  Names

>**Note**: The source name appears both at the Itinerary level and the Booking level.  The value at the Booking level is generally more useful.  The value at the Itinerary level represents that value of the first booking added to the Itinerary and could therefore be misleading.
