A ERP Partner has two options to obtain data for financial journal entries into the ERP:

*  Financial Integration Service (FIS) – data is returned via APIs.
*  Extract files – data is written to a flat file on a batched schedule.

We recommend using data from FIS whenever possible due to the efficiency and advantages it has over batched extract files. If a customer’s ERP requires a file then the partner will create their own file based on FIS data, not the extract.

Using FIS data for either of the above situations will simplify processes and enable FIS benefits.

FIS has these benefits over the Extract file process:

* Maintains consistency between SAP Concur solutions and the ERP:
  * FIS requires a post of the status of the ERP integration back into the SAP Concur solution, per report or invoice. If there is a failure at the ERP, the app will update the affected report or invoice with an error message. The customer will initiate corrective action from within the SAP Concur processor tool. The result is that no expense report or invoice will advance until it can be integrated into the ERP. This process is a change for existing SAP Concur customers who are not accustomed to this awareness between their ERP and SAP Concur solutions.

  * For existing SAP Concur customers, enabling FIS also requires change management discussions regarding expense reports and invoices in process during the switch. Any report created after FIS is enabled will flow to FIS and not the extract file. Reports still in process when FIS is enabled will be accounted for only via the extract file. Customers need to manage their existing integration until those reports or invoices are completely processed.

* Real-time integration into the ERP:
  * Partner will obtain final approved spend data throughout the day and post it to the ERP instead of waiting for the file-based interval to occur once per day.
* Payment Confirmation:
  * ERP partners have the ability to post a payment status of reports into SAP Concur solutions (Expense only at this time).

## <a name="new"></a>New SAP Concur Customers

We expect all new SAP Concur customers will use FIS data instead of extract files (*Life Science customers probably will need the Attendee Detail extract file created until an API is released for Attendee transactions*).

## <a name="existing"></a>Existing SAP Concur Customers

Existing customers likely have integrations in place based on SAP Concur extracts. The partner and the customer will determine if FIS data can replace all of the customer's integrations. For example, customers may use the extract file content for import into their ERP and into analytical databases.

By default, SAP Concur extract files are disabled when FIS is enabled. The partner and the customer will determine if they need any extracts created in addition to enabling FIS:

* Standard Accounting Extract (SAE)
  * FIS will replace the need to use the SAE for journal entries.
  * Does the customer use the SAE for any analytical requirements? If yes, then you will review the FIS data to determine if it can be used instead of the SAE.
* Payment Request Accounting Extract (PRAE) - same as above.
* Attendee Details Extract
  * Used for compliance reporting purposes. This file can still be created even if FIS is used.
  * You will submit a case for this file to be continued as an "informational extract." We will need to setup this informational extract based on the customer's request.
* Expense Pay Confirmation Extract

## <a name="tips"></a>Configuration Tips

Product Configuration is required to ensure reports route properly through FIS instead of Extract process:

* FI Service is enabled at the Expense group level.
* This value is copied down to the Report Header as a hidden field.
* The “enabled” value at the Report Header will not change even as the feature may be toggled on/off.
* This ensures no cross pollination – inclusion of a report in both posting document and extract.

 Any report or invoice created after enablement will flow through to FIS.  Existing reports or invoices with a Create Date prior to enablement will continue to flow through the extract file process. Existing customers need to manage the in-flight reports and invoices but your team needs to raise this topic to ensure everyone is in agreement. Does the customer prefer a parallel process of their existing, file-based process plus the FIS process? Or will the customer want to process all reports and invoices prior to enabling FIS? The latter option will require prohibiting users from creating a new report or invoice until all existing reports and invoices are processed and FIS is enabled.

## <a name="extracts"></a>Accounting Extracts

*	Reports configured for the FIS flow will not be included in the traditional accounting extract.
*	Reports NOT enabled for FIS flow will continue to be included in the SAE.
*	Informational extracts are always available and typically managed by Implementation and Support services.
*	Informational extracts are not intended for financial integration purposes.
  *	They lack the level of control to eliminate duplicates or missing data.
	* You should rely on a single source of truth for your posting information: either SAE or FIS posting documents.
  *	Informational extracts supplement the SAE or FIS posting documents (Attendee, VAT, Expense Pay).
  *	Output is based on new transactions since last run and reports in p_paid status.

## <a name="expense-pay"></a>Expense Pay

*	Batch close process calls FIS to confirm if expense report is successfully posted.
*	Demand is processed and is sent to the bank if status in FIS = SUCCESS.
*	Demand is not processed and is not sent to the bank if status in FIS = FAILED.
*	These statuses are determined by the Posting Confirmation API.
*	This “check” ensures that money is only reimbursed for reports successfully posted in the ERP.
*	When reports are extracted using the SAE/extract file process, payment demands are sent to the bank independent of the customer’s financial posting.

## <a name="nonexpense-pay"></a>Non-Expense Pay Payment Batches (Standard Edition and S2P)

* Current extract process requires a “batch close” event to trigger the extract job and generate the extract.
* FIS flow is triggered each time a report reaches the proper workflow status and has no dependency on the status of a batch resulting in a near real-time financial posting process.

## <a name="sequence-flow"></a>API Sequence Flow

The flow consists of calling the API in this sequence:

1. [Get Financial Transactions](/api-reference/financial-integration/v4.financial-integration.html#get-transactions) - Obtain final-approved reports (or invoices) from the FIS queue.
1. [Post Financial Transaction Acknowledgements](/api-reference/financial-integration/v4.financial-integration.html#post-acknowledgements) - Acknowledge each report or invoice has been obtained.
1. [Post Financial Transactions Confirmations](/api-reference/financial-integration/v4.financial-integration.html#post-confirmations) - Post the status of the ERP integration for each report (success or failure) back into the SAP Concur solution after integrating into the customer's ERP.
1. [Post Financial Payment Confirmations](/api-reference/financial-integration/v4.financial-integration.html#payment-confirmations) - Post the financial payment results into the SAP Concur solution.

The following are the recommended steps when you create a file based on FIS data prior to importing into the ERP:

1. You will remove any report (or invoice) from your file if it is rejected at the ERP.
1. You will then post a rejected status for that report back into the SAP Concur solution via FIS post confirmation endpoint. (see step 3 above)
1. The customer will then address any rejected reports directly in the SAP Concur solution where they will be re-processed at a later date and eventually included in FIS.
1. You will re-try your file without the rejected reports. Upon 100% successful import of the remaining reports, you will post successful statuses of those reports back into the SAP Concur solution via FIS.

The above steps will maintain consistency between the customer's ERP and their SAP Concur Spend Management service. If they cannot be performed due to error-handling logistics between you and customer, then you can post successes for the file content back into the SAP Concur solution. The customer will handle the errors directly with the ERP. However, their ERP and the SAP Concur data will not be in sync at this point.

## <a name="timing"></a>Timing to Run FIS

You will review the timing of the FIS API requests to ensure they are not interfering with the customer administrator's ability to send an expense report (or invoice) back to the employee prior to ERP integration.

This may require you to develop a button in the UI of your integration to allow the customer to initiate the FIS process on demand. This would free you and the customer from coordinating the timing.

For example, the SAP Concur workflow typically includes a final approval step that is completed by Finance/Accounting. Once the accountant final-approves a report (or invoice), the report is queued into FIS. If necessary, the accountant can pull this report back and send it back to the employee for adjustment prior to ERP integration, but only if you have not yet picked up the report. So, the process should include awareness of the timing between you and your customer.
